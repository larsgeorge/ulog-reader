ulog-reader
===========

This (rather loose) collection of Java classes provides a Tokyo Tyrant/Tokyo Cabinet update log (ulog) parser. There is also a parser for Redis AOF files. In addition you can find custom Hadoop InputFormat classes that wrap these readers into what is needed to use them from within MapReduce jobs.

The whole project does not compile per-se and may need a little tweaking to get it to work. It is more or less a "gist" or "scratchpad" collection.

Use at your own risk ;)
